Conventions to follow while hacking:

1. API should return data, not text.

2. functions or methods which print to stdout should be named with a
prefix of cli_ and should only be used when invoked via the
CLI. ie. API calls should not print to stdout.

3. Two blank lines after every function and method

4. Separate blocks of ideas within a function with a single blank line

5. flake8 otherwise

6. imports at the module level unless doing something tricky. Use
relative imports as appropriate

7. don't over-nest function calls. don't be afraid to use a local
variable to hold data between steps. It can be much clearer to read
later.

8. delete-trailing-whitespace

9. Run `./setup.py flake8` and `./setup.py test` and fix any
unexpected issues before committing.
