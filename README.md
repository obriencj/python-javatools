# Overview of python-javatools

A [python] module for unpacking and inspecting [Java] Class files,
JARs, and collections of either.

[python]: http://python.org
[java]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html

It can do deep checking of classes to perform comparisons of
functionality, and output reports in multiple formats.

## Requirements

* [Python] 2.6 or later (now with Python 3 support!)
* [Setuptools]
* [M2Crypto] is used for cryptographic operations

In addition, the following tools are used in building and testing the
project.

* [GNU Make]
* [Pylint]

All of these packages are available in most linux distributions
(eg. Fedora), and for OSX via [MacPorts].

[pyxml]: http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/xml-sig/
[M2Crypto]: https://gitlab.com/m2crypto/m2crypto/

[setuptools]: http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/
[gnu make]: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
[pylint]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint/

[fedora]: http://fedoraproject.org/
[macports]: http://www.macports.org


## Building

This module uses [setuptools], so running the following will build the
project:

```python setup.py build```

to install, run:

```sudo python setup.py install```


### Testing

Tests are written as `unittest` test cases. If you'd like to run the tests,
simply invoke:

```python setup.py test```

There is also a custom `pylint` command, which can be use via:

```python setup.py pylint```


### RPM

If you'd prefer to build an RPM, see the wiki entry for
[Building as an RPM].

## Javatools Scripts

* classinfo - similar to the javap utility included with most
  JVMs. Also does provides/requires tracking.

* classdiff - attempts to find differences between two Java class
  files

* jarinfo - prints information about a JAR. Also does
  provides/requires tracking.

* jardiff - prints the deltas between the contents of a JAR, and runs
  classdiff on differing Java class files contained in the JARs

* jarutil - creates JAR, signs JAR, verifies JAR signature

* manifest - creates and queries JAR manifests

* distinfo - prints information about a mixed multi-jar/class
  distribution, such as provides/requires lists.

* distdiff - attempts to find differences between two distributions,
  deep-checking any JARs or Java class files found in either
  directory.
