Overview of python-javatools
============================

A `python <http://python.org>`__ module for unpacking and inspecting
`Java <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html>`__ Class
files, JARs, and collections of either.

It can do deep checking of classes to perform comparisons of
functionality, and output reports in multiple formats.

-  `python-javatools on
   GitHub <https://github.com/obriencj/python-javatools/>`__
-  `python-javatools on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/javatools>`__

If you have suggestions, please use the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/obriencj/python-javatools/issues>`__ on
github. Or heck, just fork it!

Requirements
------------

-  `Python <http://python.org>`__ 2.6 or later (no support for Python 3)
-  `Setuptools <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__

In addition, the following tools are used in building and testing the
project.

-  `GNU Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__
-  `Pylint <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint/>`__

All of these packages are available in most linux distributions (eg.
Fedora), and for OSX via `MacPorts <http://www.macports.org>`__.

Building
--------

This module uses `setuptools <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__,
so running the following will build the project:

``python setup.py build``

to install, run:

``sudo python setup.py install``

Testing
~~~~~~~

Tests are written as ``unittest`` test cases. If you'd like to run the
tests, simply invoke:

``python setup.py test``

There is also a custom ``pylint`` command, which can be use via:

``python setup.py pylint``

RPM
~~~

If you'd prefer to build an RPM, see the wiki entry for `Building as an
RPM <https://github.com/obriencj/python-javatools/wiki/Building-as-an-RPM>`__.

Javatools Scripts
-----------------

-  classinfo - similar to the javap utility included with most JVMs.
   Also does provides/requires tracking.

-  classdiff - attempts to find differences between two Java class files

-  jarinfo - prints information about a JAR. Also does provides/requires
   tracking.

-  jardiff - prints the deltas between the contents of a JAR, and runs
   classdiff on differing Java class files contained in the JARs

-  manifest - creates manifests, signs JAR with OpenSSL

-  distinfo - prints information about a mixed multi-jar/class
   distribution, such as provides/requires lists.

-  distdiff - attempts to find differences between two distributions,
   deep-checking any JARs or Java class files found in either directory.
