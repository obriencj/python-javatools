- standardize on use of pretty_* named functions and methods

- perhaps diff-like opcode output for method code? That would be a bit
  of an undertaking; would it be at all worth it?

- a class or class-member attribute discovery script

- switch to using logging instead of print statements for CLI output
  (bad idea?)

- fill in more docstrings with meaningful explanations

- options to classinfo and jarinfo to attempt to fulfill dependencies
  (possibly recursively) from discoverable locations (JAVA_HOME,
  CLASSPATH, etc) and output missing deps

- add signature information to jarinfo.

- full classinfo --json support

- move JarChange to use a JarInfo instance rather than path name

- move DistChange to use a DistInfo instance rather than path name

- flesh out the cheetah templates for classdiff reports

- generics type signature handling

- default annotation value attribute

- pomdiff? maven-repo-diff?

- [silly] output class files from classinfo data

- [silly] implement jar signing capabilities

- given the way ACC_SUPER works, it's probably not at all useful to do
  symbol-level dependency tracking. Instead it should likely just be
  class-based. I'll need to change distinfo/jarinfo/classinfo
  accordingly.

- the cheetah MethodCodeChange template needs to show the locals, stack,
  and exception table.

- MethodCodeChange also needs to colorize the unified lines of code
  table

- the cheetah ManifestChange template needs a lot of work. What should
  a manifest delta look like?

- need some javascript magic to make cpool refs have a cute
  clicky-effect that shows their dereferenced value.

- need some javascript magic that allows hiding unchanged/ignored, or
  collapsing individual sections with a twisty.

- distreport needs a class-oriented page that allows quick jumping to
  the class reports, rather than requiring users to know which jar
  report to look in.

- dist/jar/class html reports need to link to the json and text
  variants

- for distributed text, I could use diff to generate a delta, how
  insane is that? Or perhaps the python diff module...

- invokedynamic and all of its friends need support

- investigate jinja2 as a replacement for Cheetah
